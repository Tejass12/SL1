Create SQL queries for a database application that manages
information about students and their courses. The database schema
includes the following tables:
students: Contains information about students
Columns: student_id (primary key), student_name, age, gender, email
courses: Contains information about courses
Columns: course_id (primary key), course_name, credit_hours, department
enrollments: Stores enrollment details of students in courses
Columns: enrollment_id (primary key), student_id (foreign key referencing
students table), course_id (foreign key referencing courses table),
enrollment_date
Write the SQL query that â€“
1. Retrieve the names of all students along with their enrolled courses.
2. Retrieve the total number of enrolled students in each course.
3. Retrieve the student names who have not enrolled in any course.
4. Insert a new student record into the database.
5. Update the credit hours for the course with course_id 101.
6. Delete the enrollment record for student_id 102 and course_id 105.
7. Retrieve the course names and their respective departments using a
subquery.
8. Create a view to display the details of enrolled students and their courses.
9. Retrieve the details of students who have enrolled in more than one course.
10. Retrieve the course names and credit hours for all courses along with the
names of students enrolled in each course.

2. SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS total_enrolled

3. SELECT s.student_name

4. INSERT INTO students (student_name, age, gender, email)
VALUES ('John Doe', 20, 'Male', 'johndoe@example.com');


5. UPDATE courses
SET credit_hours = 4
WHERE course_id = 101;


6. DELETE FROM enrollments
