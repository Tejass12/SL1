Write a SQL query that returns –
1. Create a database named &quot;university_db&quot; to store all the professor-related
data.
2. Create a table named &quot;professors&quot; to store professor information. The
table should have the following columns:
a. professor_id (Primary Key, Auto-incrementing)
b. professor_name (NOT NULL)
c. department (NOT NULL)
d. salary (Numeric data type)
3. All the departments in the table with no duplicates
4. The no. of professors whose salary is greater than 1,50,000
5. All departments and their aggregate salaries
6. The name and salary of the professor with highest salary
7. The name and salary of the professor with the highest salary in the “CS
Department”
8. Name and salary of the 5 highest earning professors
9. The number of unique departments in the table
10. All the professors name in the “Computer Science” department




1. CREATE DATABASE university_db;


2. USE university_db;

3. CREATE TABLE professors (
    professor_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    professor_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);


4. SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM professors;


5. SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_professors
FROM professors
WHERE salary > 150000;


6. SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM professors
GROUP BY department;


7. SELECT professor_name, salary
FROM professors
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1;


8. SELECT professor_name, salary
FROM professors
WHERE department = 'CS'
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1;


9. SELECT professor_name, salary
FROM professors
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;


10. SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) AS unique_departments
FROM professors;


11. SELECT professor_name
FROM professors
WHERE department = 'Computer Science';
